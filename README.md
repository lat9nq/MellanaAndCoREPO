# MellanaAndCo
This is a Unity mod for [REPO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/). It adds valuables, plushies designed to reference [Mellana](https://www.twitch.tv/mellana)'s character and her friends' and pals'.

For the Unity Assets, see [lat9nq/MellanaAndCoUnity](https://github.com/lat9nq/MellanaAndCoUnity)

For the original Lethal Company mod, see [lat9nq/MellanaAndCo](https://github.com/lat9nq/MellanaAndCo)

This mod depends on [REPOLib](https://github.com/ZehsTeam/REPOLib) for adding valuables.

## Details
This mod divides plushies into categories. Depending on the category, different plushies receive different rarity values. A higher rarity means it appears more frequently in the game's dungeons.

The current categories are:
- Regulars
- Mod/VIP (not implemented)
- Chat members (not implemented)

Weights are currently not implemented -- REPOLib doesn't seem to have a way to do this, so reimplementing the assets without REPOLib may be needed for newer categories.

### Plushies

The following are drop downs. Open them if you don't care for more spoilers.
