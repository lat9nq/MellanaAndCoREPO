# MellanaAndCo
This is a Unity mod for [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/). It adds lootable scrap to the game across all moons, specifically plushies designed to reference [Mellana](https://www.twitch.tv/mellana)'s character and her friends' and pals'.

For the Unity Assets, see [lat9nq/MellanaAndCoUnity](https://github.com/lat9nq/MellanaAndCoUnity)

This mod depends on [LethalLib](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalLib/) for adding scrap.

## Details

This mod divides plushies into categories. Depending on the category, different plushies receive different rarity values. A higher rarity means it appears more frequently in the game's dungeons.

The current categories are:
- Regulars
- Mod/VIP (not implemented)
- Chat members (not implemented)

### Plushies

The following are drop downs. Open them if you don't care for more spoilers. In brackets is the rarity value for each plushie in the category.
